Each part of acronym, highlights a specific step in how the REPL work.

- **Read:** The REPL reads the users input (a single line or multiple lines of code) and parses it into a data structure that the JavaScript engine can understand .

- **Eval(Evaluate):** The parsed input is evaluated (executed) by the JavaScript engine. if the input is a valid expression, the REPL computes the result.

- **Print:** The result of the evaluated expression is printed back to the console to the can se the output.
