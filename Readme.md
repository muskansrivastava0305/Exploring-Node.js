# Introduction of Node.Js
* ```0pen-source, server-side``` JavaScript runtime.
* ALLows you to run ```JavaScript``` on Your machine
* Built on the ```V8 JavaScript engine``` for speed.
* Robust ecosystem with ```npm```.

## Open Source???.
Open-source means that the ```source code of Node.js publicly available```.

**Anyone can:**
- **View:** You can see how Node.js is built under the hood.
- **Modify:** If you want to customize or improve Node.js, you can do it.
- **Contribute:** Developers around the world actively contribute to improving Node.js.

## JavaScript Runtime Environment ??.
JavaScript runtime environment refer to the ```environment where your javaScript code run.```

**In browser:** JavaScript typically runs in the browser(like chrome or firebox)to handle frontend tasks.

**With Node.js:**

Node.js allows JavaScript to run outside the browser, on the server.
it provides tools to interact with the system , like.
```File system```(res/write files).

```Network```(handle HTTP requests).

```Database```(connect to database like MongoDB pr MySQL).

## Why is Node.js Special as a Runtime?

**V8 Engine**:

Node.js uses``` Google Chrome V8``` engine to compile JavaScript into machine code, making it lighting-fast.

**Built-n API**:

Node.js comes with ```built-in API``` (like fs for file system or http for server) so you can built powerful;; application without extra libraries

## Why do we need Node.js?

**SIngle Language for Full Stack Development:**

- Developers can use JavaScript for both frontend and backend, reducing complexity.
-For example , a MERN sack project(MongoDB, Express, React,NODE).

**High Performance:**

- Thanks to the V8 engine ,Node.js is super fast.
- it can handle thousands of simultaneous connections with ease.

**Event-driven and Non-Blocking I/O:**

- Unlike traditional servers that block a thread for each request, Node.js use an asynchronous model , making it highly efficient for handling multiple tasks.

**Scalable for Modern Applications:**

- Ideal for real-time application like chat apps streaming platforms or online games.
