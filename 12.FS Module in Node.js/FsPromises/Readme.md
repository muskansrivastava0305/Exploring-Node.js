# fs/promises Module - Node.js

The fs/promises module provides a promise-based API for interacting with the filesystem, allowing asynchronous operation to be handled using modern JavaScript features like async/await or .then() chains. It is part of the fs  module in Node.js but designed for those who prefer promises over callback-based or synchronous methods.

***Purpose:*** Simplifies asynchronous file operations by using promises making the code more readable and modern compared to ..........................callback-based approaches.
